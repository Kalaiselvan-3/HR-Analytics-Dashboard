# HR-Analytics-Dashboard
Project Description:
Developed an interactive HR Analytics Dashboard using Microsoft Power BI to analyze and visualize key workforce metrics that support strategic human resource decision-making. The dashboard consolidates employee data to provide insights into attrition, employee demographics, performance, tenure, and department-wise trends, enabling HR teams to identify patterns, improve retention strategies, and enhance organizational effectiveness.

The dashboard transforms raw HR data into actionable insights through dynamic visualizations and filters, helping HR managers and business leaders monitor workforce health and make data-driven decisions.
